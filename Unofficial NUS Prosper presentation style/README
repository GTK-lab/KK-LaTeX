A presentation style in Prosper for National University of Singapore's (NUS) is provided. The style is adapted from Mathieu Goutelle's capsules style. A graphic file of NUS logo (named nus-hlogo-color) must be installed for this style. This file can be downloaded from http://www.nus.edu.sg/identity/logo/idspecs.htm from my time at least.
